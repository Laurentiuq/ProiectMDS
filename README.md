# Quizz App

This is a mobile app (done in React Native) designed to provide users with a fun and interactive way to test their knowledge on various subjects they will encounter 
throughout their college years. The intention behind it is to make it easier for students at University of Bucharest to revise or learn when they are 
preparing for "sesiune".
Imagine you are studying for your next exam in Computer Networking and you'd like to evaluate yourself on how much you know so far. You can just open the
quizz app, login or register, select "join a quizz" and take as many quizzes as you feel like in order to better your understanding of the subject. The 
quizzes can either have generic questions that are meant to test your general knowledge about the basic concepts of that certain subject, or they can 
include questions from past exams. 
With this app we hope to improve our users grades and make them happy!üòä
